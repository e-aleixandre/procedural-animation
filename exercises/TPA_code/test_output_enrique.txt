Building fluid...
Cube built

CONFIGURATION [build_fluid]:
A volume of fluid with total volume: 1.0
Viscosity: mu=0.1. Stiffness: k=3.0
Surface tension: nu=1.0. Threshold: 1.0
A cube of edge 1.0 has been built
particles per edge: 3 at a distance 1.0
Density is 980 with total mass 1.0
We have 27 particles with mass 0.037037037037037035
With an smoothing length of 1.0, which should yield 35 neighbours (aprox)
